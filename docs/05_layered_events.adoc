= Layered Events
:csv-url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-meetups/modeling-worked-example/master/data/
:icons: font

Here we are going to build a hybrid recommendation engine that takes lots of factors into account.

Let's create some scoring functions in APOC so we can use those inside queries.

Anyway this is what we have to start with:

* events in my groups
* events I’ve previously attended
* topics I’m interested in
* events my peers attend

As a member of several meetup groups who has previously attended events
I want to find other events hosted by those groups
So that I can attend those events

== Find the social graph lurking within

I have no idea how long this takes to run - had it using a Python script in the talk
Perhaps this is another candidate for procedures?

MATCH (m1:Member)
MATCH (m1)-[:RSVPD {response: 'yes'}]->(event:Event)<-[:RSVPD {response: 'yes'}]-(m2:Member)

WHERE times >= 5
WITH m1, m2, times, [event IN events | SIZE((event)<-[:RSVPD {response: 'yes'}]-())] AS attendances
WITH m1, m2, REDUCE(score = 0.0, a IN attendances | score + (1.0 / a)) AS score

MERGE (m1)-[friendsRel:FRIENDS]-(m2)
SET friendsRel.score = score
