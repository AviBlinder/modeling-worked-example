== Collaborative filtering

This query is too slow so we can't use it at the moment:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (member:Member {name: "Mark Needham"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-()-[:MEMBER_OF]->(otherGroup)
RETURN otherGroup.name, COUNT(*) AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
----



== Hybrid

I don't like these queries - I think we should change them to use the INTERESTED_IN relationship that we create a bit further on
Can also show how you could run a procedure to keep those inferred interests up to date later on maybe?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (member:Member {name: "Mark Needham"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(topic)
WITH member, topic, COUNT(*) AS score
MATCH (topic)<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-(otherGroup)
WHERE NOT (member)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(otherGroup)
RETURN otherGroup.name, COLLECT(topic.name), SUM(score) as score
ORDER BY score DESC
----
