== Exercise: Find yourself and your groups

We've now got groups, topics and members loaded into our database so it's time for a bit more exploration.

* If you're from London write a query to find yourself in the database. If not try and find your neighbour.
* How many groups are you a member of?
* Which topics do those groups have?
* _(For bonus points)_ Which topic shows up the most?
