What else can we add to the model to come up with more interesting recommendations?
Here you have some time to play around with the data and come up with something new

== Ideas

* Comments sentiment analysis - do people actually like the events they go to?
* Topic ontology - how are topics related? e.g. Neo4j, Cassandra, MongoDB are part of NoSQL
* Event similarity based on descriptions - use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to derive categories
* Social network - what events do our twitter/Facebook friends attend?
* Location - do we favour events in a certain part of town?
* Day of the week - do we only go to events on certain days of the week?  do we go to different events on weekdays vs weekend?
